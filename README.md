## Introduction

GitCard is a small app made with :love: with Typescript, React, and bundled with webpack, which was basically a challenge made by the vikings of superchat, and I accepted it with a spirit of a warrior :axe:

## Quick start

Just close this repo into your own repository and then let the magic start :fireworks: :tada:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hamzahsn/superchat-frontend-challenge.git
cd superchat-frontend-challenge
npm install
npm run start:profile
```

After this, you should get an open navigator with the link: `http://localhost:8080/` otherwise you can just go to that :link:

and then you will have a beautiful card:

then once you have put a username and a repository and chose a color and picked a color and submitted then you will have your magic link :sparkles:

And then you can navigate to it and you can see your magic card:

## folder structure

I got inspired from the atomic structure to create this project, where I have put all my small components such as inputs, buttons, typography...inside Atoms folder under component, and for my small container I user Organisms for that which will hold my card basically, and I have added another page folder to contain every page that have a separate route.
